    <h1>About ME</h1>
    <div class="para">
        <p>I’m a versatile and self-motivated Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both web development and AI-driven technologies. I specialize in building scalable, user-friendly applications using modern frontend and backend technologies, while also exploring the potential of machine learning and generative AI in real-world problem solving.

I’ve gained practical experience through multiple internships and personal projects—most notably developing DSA GPT, an AI-powered assistant built with Google Gemini 2.0, integrated into a responsive web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve also worked with Python, Selenium, SQL, and cloud platforms like Google Cloud to automate workflows and enhance user functionality.

My recent internship at Anyatam-Adhyayan Education Services sharpened my skills in data preprocessing, ML model development, and collaborative project delivery. I also completed a virtual internship with India Edu Community by Google for Developers, gaining hands-on exposure to Kotlin and database design.

I’m passionate about continuous learning and building impactful software that blends great design with intelligent functionality. Currently, I’m seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative teams where I can grow as a developer and AI practitioner.</p>
